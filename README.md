## Background
Using [PokéAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI) (a RESTful Pokémon API) to practice with JSON data using the Fetch API, Express API and React in JavaScript....and catch 'em all.

A **RESTful API** is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

### Fetch API
The ![Fetch API](./client-fetch/) provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.

### Express API
![Express.js](./express-api/) is a web application framework for Node.js is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

### MongoDB
![MongoDB](./mongodb/) is an open-source document-based database system. A key benefit is its ability to scale up with ease and hold very large amounts of data. MongoDB stores documents in collections within databases - JSON-like objects with schemata.

### Mongoose
![Mongoose](./mongodb/mongoose.md) is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
