## MongoDB

### Compared to Relational Databases
Relational DB | Mongo DB
--------------|--------------
Databases     | Database
Tables        | Collections
Records (Rows)| Documents

Relational databases are usually based on relationships between tables; in contrast, in Mongo relationships between collections and documents are managed manually (in embedded relationships, or in two separate documents)

```terminal
$ brew install mongodb
```
